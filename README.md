## Hello there, I am Jack AKA Jamming17

### About Me
I am (almost) a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in many forms of software development. I am currently based in the UK and actively seeking opportunities in south England and in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. My degree has given me a solid foundation in many programming languages, full-stack development, cloud development, machine learning and secure development. I have completed many projects - solo and in teams - including a social media platform deployed with Microsoft Azure, a custom language interpreter in Haskell, game development in Java, Python and JavaScript, a booking system in C#, and an LLM-assisted e-learning platform in Java.

I am particularly passionate about writing clean and efficient code to ease collaboration work and keeping software secure and protected against vulnerabilities. I am looking to bring my adaptability, enthusiasm and problem-solving skills into the tech industry as I begin my career.
